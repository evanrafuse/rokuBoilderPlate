# rokuBoilerPlate
WIP empty template project for future Roku Projects

This project is just a barebones Roku app to help me set up projects quickly. To use it, download the Brightscript VS Code extension and drop a .env file into the root folder of the project.

The .env should look like this:
ROKU_USERNAME=rokudev
HOST=(Your Roku's IP address)
ROKU_PASSWORD=(your password)

After that if you open the project folder in VS Code you should be able to sideload from the debug tab.
