# rokuBoilerPlate
Empty template project for future Roku Projects

This project is just a barebones Roku app to help me set up projects quickly. To use it, download the Brightscript VS Code extension and update the env file.

After that if you open the project folder in VS Code you should be able to sideload from the debug tab.
